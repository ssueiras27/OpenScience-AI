<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Diffusion models (DMs) have become the new trend of generative models and have demonstrated a powerful ability of conditional synthesis. Among those, text-to-image diffusion models pre-trained on large-scale image-text pairs are highly controllable by customizable prompts. Unlike the unconditional generative models that focus on low-level attributes and details, text-to-image diffusion models contain more high-level knowledge thanks to the vision-language pre-training. In this paper, we propose VPD (Visual Perception with a pre-trained Diffusion model), a new framework that exploits the semantic information of a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model in visual perception tasks. Instead of using the pre-trained denoising autoencoder in a diffusion-based pipeline, we simply use it as a backbone and aim to study how to take full advantage of the learned knowledge. Specifically, we prompt the denoising decoder with proper textual inputs and refine the text features with an adapter, leading to a better alignment to the pre-trained stage and making the visual contents interact with the text prompts. We also propose to utilize the cross-attention maps between the visual features and the text features to provide explicit guidance. Compared with other pre-training methods, we show that vision-language pre-trained diffusion models can be faster adapted to downstream visual perception tasks using the proposed VPD. Extensive experiments on semantic segmentation, referring image segmentation and depth estimation demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. Notably, VPD attains 0.254 RMSE on NYUv2 depth estimation and 73.3% oIoU on RefCOCOval referring image segmentation, establishing new records on these two benchmarks. Code is available at https: //github.com/wl-zhao/VPD.</p></div>

By leveraging large-scale datasets of image-text pairs (e.g., LAION-5B <ref type="bibr" coords="1,323.72,536.89,14.94,8.64" target="#b44">[46]</ref>), text-to-image diffusion models exhibit favorable scaling ability. Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models are able to generate high-quality images with rich texture, diverse content and reasonable structures while having compositional and editable semantics. This phenomenon potentially suggests that large text-to-image diffusion models can implicitly learn both high-level and low-level visual concepts from massive image-text pairs. Moreover, recent research <ref type="bibr" coords="1,344.64,632.53,15.77,8.64" target="#b17">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,363.00,632.53,13.28,8.64" target="#b34">36]</ref> also has highlighted the clear correlations between the latent visual features and corresponding words in text prompts in text-to-image diffusion models. The compelling generative semantic and compositional abilities of text-to-image diffusion models motivate us to think: is it possible to extract the visual knowledge learned by large diffusion models for visual perception tasks? However, it is non-trivial to solve this problem. Conventional visual pre-training methods aim to encode the input image as latent representations and learn the representations with pretext tasks like contrastive learning <ref type="bibr" coords="2,253.33,111.34,15.77,8.64" target="#b16">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,273.09,111.34,13.28,8.64" target="#b9">10]</ref> and masked image modeling <ref type="bibr" coords="2,166.58,123.30,10.79,8.64" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,179.82,123.30,13.28,8.64" target="#b15">17]</ref> or massive annotations in classification and vision-language tasks. The pre-training process makes the learned latent representation naturally suitable for a range of visual perception tasks as semantic knowledge is extracted from the raw images. In contrast, text-to-image models are designed to generate high-fidelity images based on textual prompts. Text-to-image diffusion models take as input random noises and text prompts, and aim to produce images through a progressive denoising process <ref type="bibr" coords="2,68.97,230.89,15.77,8.64" target="#b41">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,87.00,230.89,11.83,8.64" target="#b18">20]</ref>. While there is a notable gap between the textto-image generation task and the conventional visual pretraining mechanisms, the training process of text-to-image models also requires them to capture both low-level knowledge of images (e.g., textures, edge, and structures) and high-level semantic relations between visual and linguistic concepts from diverse and large-scale image-text pairs in an implicit way. Although rich representations are learned in large diffusion models, it is still unknown how to extract this knowledge for various visual perception tasks and whether it can benefit visual perception.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cross-Attention Maps</head><note type="other">Denoising UNet</note><p>In this paper, we study how to leverage the knowledge learned in text-to-image for visual perception. Compared to transferring knowledge from conventional pre-trained models to downstream visual perception tasks, there are two distinct challenges to performing transfer learning on diffusion models: the incompatibility between the diffusion pipeline and visual perception tasks and the architectural differences between UNet <ref type="bibr" coords="2,108.77,453.46,15.45,8.64" target="#b42">[44]</ref>-like diffusion models and popular visual backbones. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a new framework called VPD to adapt pre-trained diffusion models for visual perception tasks. Instead of using the step-bystep diffusion pipeline, we propose to simply employ the autoencoder as a backbone model to directly consume the natural images without noise and perform a single extra denoising step with designed prompts to extract the semantic information. Our framework is based on popular Stable Diffusion <ref type="bibr" coords="2,77.40,561.05,16.60,8.64" target="#b41">[43]</ref> models, which conduct the denoising process in a learned latent space with a UNet architecture. We extract features from different hierarchies from the UNet decoder to construct visual representations of the input image. To align with the pre-trained stage and facilitate interactions between visual content and text prompts, we prompt the denoising diffusion model with proper textual inputs and refine the text features with an adapter. Additionally, inspired by previous studies on the relations between prompt words and visual patterns in diffusion models, we propose to utilize the cross-attention maps between the visual and text features to provide explicit guidance. The combined implicit and explicit guidance can be fed to various visual decoders to perform visual perception tasks. Our main idea is summarized in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,407.93,87.43,3.74,8.64" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>We evaluate our method on three representative visual perception tasks covering: 1) semantic segmentation <ref type="bibr" coords="2,326.42,124.97,16.60,8.64" target="#b56">[58]</ref> which requires the understanding of high-level and fine-grained visual concepts, 2) referring image segmentation <ref type="bibr" coords="2,335.11,148.88,15.77,8.64" target="#b54">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,354.44,148.88,13.28,8.64" target="#b31">33]</ref> that requires the ability of visual-language modeling, and 3) depth estimation <ref type="bibr" coords="2,453.01,160.84,16.60,8.64" target="#b45">[47]</ref> that requires lowlevel and structural knowledge of images. With the help of the proposed VPD, we show that a vision-language pretrained diffusion model can be a fast and powerful learner of downstream visual perception tasks. Our method attains 73.3% oIoU and 0.254 RMSE on RefCOCO <ref type="bibr" coords="2,514.39,220.61,16.60,8.64" target="#b54">[56]</ref> referring image segmentation and NYUv2 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,480.65,232.57,16.60,8.64" target="#b45">[47]</ref> depth estimation, respectively, establishing new state-of-the-art on these two benchmarks. Equipped with a lightweight Semantic FPN <ref type="bibr" coords="2,359.14,268.43,16.60,8.64" target="#b22">[24]</ref> decoder, our model achieves 54.6% mIoU on ADE20K <ref type="bibr" coords="2,363.53,280.39,15.27,8.64" target="#b56">[58]</ref>, outperforming supervisedly pre-trained ConvNeXt-XL <ref type="bibr" coords="2,371.07,292.34,16.60,8.64" target="#b27">[29]</ref> model with comparable computational complexity. We also exhibit that models pre-trained with diffusion tasks can fast obtain 44.7% mIoU on this challenging benchmark with only 4K iteration training, outperforming existing pre-training methods. We expect our study to offer a new perspective on learning more generic visual representations with generative models and spark further research on bridging and unifying the vibrant research fields of image generation and perception.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Work</head><p>Diffusion Models. Diffusion denoising probabilistic models, also known as diffusion models, have emerged as a new prevailing family of generative models that demonstrate remarkable synthesis quality and controllability. The fundamental concept behind the diffusion model involves training a denoising autoencoder to learn the inverse of a Markovian diffusion process <ref type="bibr" coords="2,437.96,513.23,15.77,8.64" target="#b46">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,457.63,513.23,11.83,8.64" target="#b18">20]</ref>. With proper reparameterization, the training objective of diffusion models can be formulated as a simple weighted MSE loss <ref type="bibr" coords="2,526.03,537.14,15.27,8.64" target="#b18">[20]</ref>, which makes diffusion models enjoy more stable training compared with GANs <ref type="bibr" coords="2,399.57,561.05,16.60,8.64" target="#b14">[16]</ref> and VAEs <ref type="bibr" coords="2,461.83,561.05,15.27,8.64" target="#b21">[23]</ref>. Sampling from a diffusion model <ref type="bibr" coords="2,387.03,573.01,15.77,8.64" target="#b47">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,407.16,573.01,12.45,8.64" target="#b24">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,423.99,573.01,13.28,8.64" target="#b28">30]</ref> can then be viewed as a progressive denoising procedure, which requires multiple evaluations of the denoising autoencoder. As a step towards high-resolution image synthesis based on diffusion models, Rombach et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,411.52,620.83,16.60,8.64" target="#b41">[43]</ref> propose the latent diffusion models (LDMs), which perform diffusion on a latent space of a lower resolution and thus can significantly reduce the computational costs. They also propose a generic solution to add conditions via the cross-attention <ref type="bibr" coords="2,495.67,668.65,16.60,8.64" target="#b49">[51]</ref> mechanism. These advancements allow for training text-to-image diffusion models on a large-scale dataset LAION-5B <ref type="bibr" coords="2,526.03,692.56,15.27,8.64" target="#b44">[46]</ref>, which are now available in the famous "Stable-Diffusion"  To better exploit the semantic knowledge learned from text-to-image generation pre-training, we prompt the denoising UNet with properly designed text prompts and employ the cross-attention maps to provide both implicit and explicit guidance to downstream visual perception tasks. Our framework can fully leverage both the low-level and high-level pre-trained knowledge and can be applied in a variety of visual perception tasks. library. Recent work by <ref type="bibr" coords="3,150.76,286.77,16.60,8.64" target="#b17">[19]</ref> has witnessed a clear visualtext correlation in the large text-to-image diffusion models, which motivates us to study whether the pre-trained knowledge can be exploited to facilitate downstream visual perception tasks. Different from previous diffusion-based framework <ref type="bibr" coords="3,95.76,346.55,10.79,8.64" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,108.83,346.55,8.30,8.64" target="#b0">1]</ref> that reformulate the visual perception task as progressive denoising, we employ the denoising autoencoder pre-trained on the text-to-image generation as a backbone and study how to make full use of the learned highlevel and low-level knowledge, which only require a single forward pass of the denoising autoencoder.</p><p>Visual Pre-training.</p><p>The pre-training &amp; fine-tuning paradigm has significantly pushed the development of computer vision, especially in downstream visual perception tasks where labels are hard to collect. The most widely used pre-training is supervised pre-training on large-scale image classification datasets like ImageNet <ref type="bibr" coords="3,228.41,482.10,15.27,8.64" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Besides, self-supervised learning such as contrastive learning <ref type="bibr" coords="3,259.90,494.06,10.79,8.64" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,273.09,494.06,13.28,8.64" target="#b16">18]</ref> and masked image modelling <ref type="bibr" coords="3,172.07,506.01,15.77,8.64" target="#b36">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,190.96,506.01,13.28,8.64" target="#b15">17]</ref> have also proved to be able to learn transferrable representations. In this paper, we will demonstrate that large-scale text-to-image generation can also be a possible alternative for visual pre-training. Different from the standard visual pre-training methods that are specifically designed for extracting high-level representation of visual data, a model trained on a generative task focuses on the synthesis quality and captures more lowlevel clues. However, our results show that due to the existence of natural language during pre-training, a well-learned text-to-image diffusion model contains sufficient both highlevel and low-level knowledge, which can also be applied in downstream visual perception tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Method</head><p>In this section, we present VPD, a new framework that achieves visual perception with a pre-trained diffusion model. Our key idea is to investigate how to fully extract the pre-trained high-level knowledge in a pre-trained text-toimage diffusion model. We will start by reviewing the background of diffusion models, and then describe our designs of VPD, including how to implicitly and explicitly leverage the visual-language correspondence lies in the pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models. The overall framework of our VPD is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,437.27,370.46,3.74,8.64" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Preliminaries: Diffusion Models</head><p>To begin with, we will provide a brief overview of the diffusion models <ref type="bibr" coords="3,379.28,420.21,15.77,8.64" target="#b46">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,398.00,420.21,12.45,8.64" target="#b18">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,413.40,420.21,11.83,8.64" target="#b20">22]</ref>. Diffusion models are a new family of generative models that can reconstruct the distribution of data by learning the reverse process of a diffusion process. Denoting z t as the random variable at t-th timestep, the diffusion process is modeled as a Markov:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="3,364.50,482.58,180.62,16.57">z t ∼ N ( √ α t z t−1 , (1 − α t )I),<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where {α t } are fixed coefficients that determine the noise schedule. The above definition leads to a simple close form of p(z t |z 0 ):</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="3,372.98,549.29,172.13,53.08">z t = √ ᾱt z 0 + √ 1 − ᾱt ᾱt = t s=1 α s , ∼ N (0, I),<label>(2)</label></formula><p>which further allows sampling an arbitrary z t efficiently during training. With proper re-parameterization, the training objective of diffusion models can be derived as <ref type="bibr" coords="3,513.95,637.05,15.49,8.64" target="#b18">[20]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="3,338.02,656.44,207.09,12.69">L DM = E z0, ,t − θ (z t (z 0 , ), t; C) 2 2 ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where z t is computed as Equation ( <ref type="formula" coords="3,450.28,680.60,3.53,8.64" target="#formula_1">2</ref>). θ is an autoencoder (usually implemented as a UNet <ref type="bibr" coords="3,438.89,692.56,15.93,8.64" target="#b42">[44]</ref>) that is learned to predict the given the conditioning inputs C. The sampling of diffusion models is achieved by discretizing the diffusion SDE or ODE <ref type="bibr" coords="4,105.33,87.43,16.60,8.64" target="#b48">[50]</ref> thus requires multiple model evaluations at different timesteps.</p><p>The training objective (3) enables stable training of diffusion models, even with complex conditioning inputs. Recently, <ref type="bibr" coords="4,128.67,136.19,16.60,8.64" target="#b41">[43]</ref> released a text-to-image model (namely "Stable-Diffusion") trained on large-scale imagetext dataset LAION-5B <ref type="bibr" coords="4,149.69,160.10,15.27,8.64" target="#b44">[46]</ref>, which has demonstrated remarkable performance on image synthesis controlled by natural language. Specifically, they first train a VQGAN consisting of an encoder E and a decoder D, which can achieve the conversion between the pixel space and the latent space. They then train a diffusion model on that latent space with the same objective in Equation <ref type="bibr" coords="4,241.76,231.83,10.58,8.64" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. In this work, we will exploit how to fully use the learned high-level knowledge of the pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model in the downstream visual tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Prompting Text-to-Image Diffusion Model</head><p>A pre-trained diffusion model contains sufficient information to sample from the data distribution since the model θ can be viewed as the learned gradient of data density ∇ zt log p(z t |C) <ref type="bibr" coords="4,117.18,345.16,10.58,8.64" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. As for the text-to-image model, we believe that there is enough high-level knowledge due to the weak supervision of the natural language during pretraining. Our goal is to fully exploit the knowledge of a well-trained text-conditioned θ and transfer the learned knowledge to downstream visual perception tasks. A general perception task aims to model the distribution p(y|x), where y is the task-specific label and x is the input image. Our basic idea is to build a connection between the task-specific label and the natural language, such that the learned semantic information can be efficiently extracted.</p><p>To achieve this, we first rewrite the prediction model as p φ (y|x, S), where S is a set containing all the category names of the task. This is reasonable since the label y is related to the S in both shape and semantic meaning. We then implement p φ (y|x, S) as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="4,74.75,547.96,207.75,9.65">p φ (y|x, S) = p φ3 (y|F)p φ2 (F|x, C)p φ1 (C|S), (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4" coords="4,282.49,548.28,3.87,8.64">)</formula><p>where F is a set of feature maps and C denotes the text features. We now describe each term in Equation ( <ref type="formula" coords="4,250.28,584.03,3.87,8.64" target="#formula_3">4</ref>) and its instantiation in detail: (1) p φ1 (C|S) is responsible to extract text features from the class names. We use the same CLIP <ref type="bibr" coords="4,204.75,620.83,16.60,8.64" target="#b37">[39]</ref> text encoder as the pre-training stage of Stable-Diffusion <ref type="bibr" coords="4,217.76,632.78,15.27,8.64" target="#b41">[43]</ref>, and the text inputs are simply defined using a template of "a photo of a [CLS]". However, the domain gap is usually witnessed when transferring the text encoder to downstream tasks <ref type="bibr" coords="4,73.12,680.60,15.77,8.64" target="#b57">[59,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,91.96,680.60,11.83,8.64" target="#b13">15]</ref>. Inspired by <ref type="bibr" coords="4,161.37,680.60,15.27,8.64" target="#b13">[15]</ref>, we use a text adapter implemented as a two-layer MLP to refine the text features obtained by the CLIP text encoder. To sum up, the text fea-tures are computed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5" coords="4,368.68,105.30,176.44,38.63">T ← {template(s)|s ∈ S} C ← CLIPTextEncoder(T ) C ← C + γ MLP(C),<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where T denotes the raw texts generated by applying the prompt template to the set of class names and γ is a learnable scale factor that is initialized to be very small (e.g., 1e-4). This design can help us to maximally preserve the pretrained knowledge of the text encoder, as well as mitigate the domain gap between the pre-training task and the downstream task. Note that different from the usage of CLIP text encoder in <ref type="bibr" coords="4,355.53,249.19,16.60,8.64" target="#b41">[43]</ref> where the features of the whole sentence are used, we simply use the feature from the [EOS] token. Therefore, the shape of C is |S| × C where C is the output dimension of the CLIP text encoder.</p><p>(2) p φ2 (F|x, C) aims to extract hierarchical feature maps F given the input image x and the conditioning inputs C. Since C contains information from the natural language, p φ2 needs to capture the cross-domain interactions between vision and language. Interestingly, we find the pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model can be a very good initialization of p phi2 . Although θ is trained to perform scorematching <ref type="bibr" coords="4,348.65,385.03,16.60,8.64" target="#b48">[50]</ref> according to the training objective, it has already bridged the vision and language domains. In our implementation, we first use the encoder of the VQGAN E to encode the image into the latent space (e.g., z 0 = E(x)) and then feed the latent feature map and the conditioning inputs to the pre-trained θ network. Note that we simply set t = 0 such that no noise is added to the latent feature map. The hierarchical features F can also be easily obtained from the last layer of each output block in different resolutions. Typically, the size of the input image is 512 × 512 and F contains 4 feature maps, where the i-th feature map F i has the spatial size of</p><formula xml:id="formula_6" coords="4,380.80,514.64,126.67,11.23">H i = W i = 2 i+2 , i = 1, 2, 3, 4.</formula><p>(3) p φ3 (y|F) is the prediction head that generates results from the hierarchical feature maps F. We implement p φ3 as a Semantic FPN <ref type="bibr" coords="4,386.10,556.73,15.27,8.64" target="#b22">[24]</ref>, consisting of several convolutional layers and upsampling layers. The prediction head can be designed to be very lightweight since the θ already has enough capacity to perform downstream vision tasks.</p><p>The above formulation enables us to decompose the general visual perception tasks such that the role of the pretrained diffusion model can be better understood. By injecting the task-specific labels S as the inputs, we implicitly prompt the pre-trained denoising autoencoder to explore the learned semantic knowledge. It is also worth noting that our method is not a diffusion-based framework anymore, because we only use a single UNet as a backbone (see Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,324.07,704.51,4.98,8.64" target="#fig_0">1</ref> to better understand the differences).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Semantic Guidance via Cross-attention</head><p>Apart from designing proper prompts to implicitly extract high-level knowledge from θ network, we also propose to use the cross-attention map as an explicit semantic guidance. It has been observed in <ref type="bibr" coords="5,207.93,129.71,16.60,8.64" target="#b17">[19]</ref> that in a welltrained text-to-image diffusion model, the cross-attention map between the feature map and the conditioning text feature enjoys good locality. This nice property motivates us to leverage the cross-attention maps to explicitly facilitate downstream visual perception. The cross-attention operation exists in each of the 4 resolutions of the θ network. Therefore, for the i-th resolution, we can simply average all the cross-attention maps belonging to the resolution to obtain an averaged map A i . Since the cross-attention maps are computed by using the conditioning inputs C as the key and value, the averaged attention map has the shape of</p><formula xml:id="formula_7" coords="5,50.11,271.28,75.94,11.23">A i ∈ R |S|×Hi×Wi .</formula><p>The averaged cross-attention map is useful because each channel of it aggregates some semantic information of a certain category. We can then concatenate the averaged cross-attention maps with the original hierarchical feature maps and fed the results to the prediction head, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8" coords="5,50.11,333.07,236.25,21.61">F i ← [F i , A i ].</formula><p>By default, we do not use the cross-attention maps at the lowest resolution since they are not very accurate (which we will analyze in the experiments). We empirically find that explicit semantic guidance through cross-attention can help our model faster adapt to downstream tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Implementation</head><p>We consider three visual perception tasks in this work, including semantic segmentation, referring image segmentation, and depth estimation. Basically, we use a similar architecture for these tasks, as mentioned above. However, there are some differences in minor design, which we will describe as follows. Firstly, the procedure to obtain the conditioning inputs C slightly differs in different tasks. For semantic segmentation, S contains the class names in the dataset. For referring image segmentation, we simply use the referring expression (a single sentence) to compute the conditioning inputs C. For depth estimation, we can build the text prompt similarly using the category name of the scene, such as "kitchen", "bathroom", etc. Second, the output channels of the task-specific head p φ3 (y|F) are different. Third, the training objective of the three tasks are varied. We use the cross-entropy loss for both semantic segmentation and referring image segmentation, while the Scale-Invariant loss (SI) [14] is used for depth estimation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Experiments</head><p>To verify the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on three visual tasks including referring image segmentation, semantic segmentation, and depth esti-mation, covering both high-level and low-level visual perception. We will first present the experimental settings of these tasks and then give our main results. We will also provide detailed ablation studies and analyses of our method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Experiment Setups</head><p>We first provide some common configurations of VPD. For all three downstream tasks, we fix the VQGAN encoder E and the CLIP text encoder during training. To fully preserve the pre-trained knowledge of the θ , we always set the learning rate of θ as 1/10 of the base learning rate. We use γ=1e-4 for the text adapter. The task-specific settings and training details are elaborated as follows.</p><p>Semantic Segmentation. The goal of semantic segmentation is to assign pixel-level labels to a given image, which requires a fine-grained high-level understanding of visual content. We evaluate our method on ADE20K <ref type="bibr" coords="5,498.70,276.58,15.27,8.64" target="#b56">[58]</ref>, which consists of 20K images for training and 2K images for validation. Since our method can adapt faster to the downstream tasks, we train our model for 80K iterations using a Semantic FPN <ref type="bibr" coords="5,370.20,324.40,16.60,8.64" target="#b22">[24]</ref> by default. We use a global batch size of 16 and set the learning rate as 1e-4. We use the AdamW optimizer with a weight decay of 1e-4 and warming-up iterations of 1500. We adopt the polynomial learning rate scheduler with a power of 0.9 and a minimum learning rate of 1e-6. For the fast schedule (8K iterations), we linear scale the learning rate schedule and set the warming-up iterations to 150. During inference, we use the slide inference with a crop size 512 × 512 and a stride of 341 × 341.</p><p>Referring Image Segmentation. Referring image segmentation aims to find the related object given a natural language expression from an image. We perform experiments on the widely used benchmark RefCOCO <ref type="bibr" coords="5,508.35,472.61,15.27,8.64" target="#b54">[56]</ref>, Re-fCOCO+ <ref type="bibr" coords="5,349.17,484.57,15.27,8.64" target="#b54">[56]</ref>, and more challenging G-Ref <ref type="bibr" coords="5,493.28,484.57,16.60,8.64" target="#b32">[34]</ref> datasets with significantly longer expressions. RefCOCO, Ref-COCO+, and G-Ref contain around 20K images and 50K annotated objects, with 142,209, 141,564, and 104,560 annotated expressions respectively. Following common practice, we train our model on the training set and evaluate the validation set. We use the overall intersection-over-union (oIoU) as the metric to compare different methods. As for the decoder head, we follow LAVT <ref type="bibr" coords="5,453.54,580.21,16.60,8.64" target="#b52">[54]</ref> which uses a simple convolution head to fusion the features and generate the semantic prediction. We train our model for 40 epochs with a total batch size of 32. We set the learning rate as 5e-5 and the weight decay as 0.01. As we have multiple expressions on a single image, during the training phase, we randomly choose a language description. In the inference time, we evaluate sequentially and calculate the mean results following common practice.</p><p>Depth Estimation. We adopt a widely used benchmark NYUv2 <ref type="bibr" coords="5,344.23,704.52,16.60,8.64" target="#b45">[47]</ref> to evaluate our method in depth estimation. NYUv2 contains 24K images for training and 645 images for testing, covering 464 indoor scenes. Following common practice, we report the absolute relative error (REL), root mean squared error (RMSE), and average log10 error between predicted depth d and the ground truth depth d. We also report the threshold accuracy δ n which denotes</p><formula xml:id="formula_9" coords="6,50.11,367.64,236.25,23.32">δ n = % of pixels satisfying max(d i / di , di /d i ) &lt; 1.25 n for n = 1, 2, 3.</formula><p>During training, we randomly crop the images to 480×480. We set the learning rate as 5e-4 and train the model for 25 epochs with batch size of 24. The decoder head and other experimental setting is the same as <ref type="bibr" coords="6,251.20,418.41,15.27,8.64" target="#b51">[53]</ref>. We use the flip and sliding windows during testing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Main Results</head><p>In this section, we will provide our main results on three downstream tasks, including semantic segmentation, referring image segmentation, and depth estimation. Apart from training the models using the default schedule, we also perform experiments on a faster scheduler with very few iterations or epochs to show that our method can quickly adapt to downstream visual perception tasks.</p><p>Semantic Segmentation. Semantic segmentation is a high-level visual perception task that requires per-pixel high-level understanding.</p><p>We evaluate our VPD on ADE20K <ref type="bibr" coords="6,90.19,596.92,16.60,8.64" target="#b56">[58]</ref> and compare it with previous backbones and pre-training methods. We start by performing experiments on the default training schedule, where we train our model with a Semantic FPN <ref type="bibr" coords="6,143.56,632.78,16.60,8.64" target="#b22">[24]</ref> head for 80K iterations. The results can be found in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,179.92,644.74,3.74,8.64" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. For fair comparisons, we do not consider complex segmentation heads such as MaskFormer <ref type="bibr" coords="6,105.21,668.65,15.27,8.64" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Instead, we compare the available result with more common segmentation heads like Semantic FPN <ref type="bibr" coords="6,72.22,692.56,16.60,8.64" target="#b22">[24]</ref> and UperNet <ref type="bibr" coords="6,149.02,692.56,15.27,8.64" target="#b50">[52]</ref>. The compared methods include self-supervised pre-training (MAE <ref type="bibr" coords="6,219.74,704.51,15.93,8.64" target="#b15">[17]</ref>) and super- vised pre-training (Swin <ref type="bibr" coords="6,409.29,255.65,16.60,8.64" target="#b26">[28]</ref> and ConvNeXt <ref type="bibr" coords="6,491.60,255.65,14.94,8.64" target="#b27">[29]</ref>). We report both the single-scale and multi-scale mIoU for all the methods. We show that VPD can achieve 53.7 mIoU ss and 54.6 mIoU ms , outperforming pre-trained ConvNeXt-XL <ref type="bibr" coords="6,325.94,303.47,16.60,8.64" target="#b27">[29]</ref> model with comparable computational complexity. Notably, while other methods utilize UPerNet <ref type="bibr" coords="6,516.91,315.42,16.60,8.64" target="#b50">[52]</ref> as the segmentation head and train the model for &gt;120K iterations, our model trained for only 80K iterations can achieve better results with a more lightweight Semantic FPN <ref type="bibr" coords="6,528.52,351.29,16.60,8.64" target="#b22">[24]</ref> head and 512×512 crop size. We further perform experiments with a faster schedule, where we train our models for only 8K iterations. We report both the single-scale and multi-scale mIoU at 4K/8K iterations, as shown in Table 2. We use A32 and A64 subscripts to represent crossattention maps with spatial sizes up to 32 and 64, respectively. For 8K iterations, we find VPD A32 surpass all the baseline methods, including those pre-trained on mask image modelling <ref type="bibr" coords="6,369.02,458.89,15.77,8.64" target="#b15">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,387.76,458.89,11.83,8.64" target="#b36">38]</ref>, contrastive learning <ref type="bibr" coords="6,488.49,458.89,11.62,8.64" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and supervised learning <ref type="bibr" coords="6,366.53,470.84,15.77,8.64" target="#b25">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,384.29,470.84,11.83,8.64" target="#b27">29]</ref>. For 4K iterations, we show VPD A64 can yield better results. The results indicate that VPD has the potential to enhance adaptation to downstream tasks and that incorporating additional semantic guidance from crossattention maps can expedite its convergence even further.</p><p>Referring Image Segmentation. Referring image segmentation also involves high-level knowledge of the correspondence between visual content and referring expression texts. We evaluate our VPD on the widely used RefCOCO <ref type="bibr" coords="6,526.03,573.01,15.27,8.64" target="#b54">[56]</ref>, RefCOCO+ <ref type="bibr" coords="6,359.80,584.96,15.27,8.64" target="#b54">[56]</ref>, and G-Ref <ref type="bibr" coords="6,428.14,584.96,15.27,8.64" target="#b31">[33]</ref>. We train our model on the training set and report the overall IoU (oIoU) on the validation set, as shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,430.13,608.87,3.74,8.64" target="#tab_3">3</ref>. Under the default training schedule, our VPD outperforms previous methods by large margins consistently on both two datasets. We also find that when trained for only 1 epoch, our VPD also achieves better overall IoU than previous state-of-the-art LAVT <ref type="bibr" coords="6,507.37,656.69,15.27,8.64" target="#b52">[54]</ref>. We hypothesize that VPD achieves superior performance due to two primary reasons: (1) unlike prior methods that rely on pre-trained language models that lack interactions with the visual modality, our VPD model leverages a pre-trained </p></div>

We first evaluate the effectiveness of the components presented in Section 3, as is shown in table 5. We perform the ablation studies on semantic segmentation, using the same training configurations as Table <ref type="table" coords="7,85.73,692.56,3.74,8.64" target="#tab_2">2</ref>.

We show that VPD outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods consistently in all the metrics.

For our baseline (the first row), we feed an empty string as the text prompt, such that no effective visual-language interactions are introduced. We find the performance of the baseline is far from satisfactory (e.g., only 46.9 mIoU at 8K iterations).</p><p>We then apply the text prompts constructed by filling the class names of ADE20K <ref type="bibr" coords="7,413.81,411.69,16.60,8.64" target="#b56">[58]</ref> to the template "a photo of a [CLS]", which can improve the mIoU@4K and mIoU@8K by 0.5 and 0.2, respectively. This reveals that a proper text prompt can build the connection between visual and language domains. To further mitigate the domain gap, we employ the text adapter after the CLIP text encoder, which brings significant improvement (42.0→42.9 in mIoU@4K and 47.1→48.0 in mIoU@8K). Finally, we add the cross-attention maps as explicit semantic guidance (the last row of Table <ref type="table" coords="7,395.53,519.28,4.15,8.64">5</ref>) and find the mIoU@8K can be further improved by 0.7. These ablation studies clearly demonstrate that our designs in VPD can effectively leverage the pre-trained knowledge of the θ via both implicit and explicit guidance.</p><p>Choice of the cross-attention maps. There are a lot of cross-attention layers in the denoising autoencoder θ . Therefore, it becomes a question that which cross-attention maps we should select to provide semantic guidance. Since Table <ref type="table" coords="8,72.09,72.34,3.36,7.77">5</ref>. Ablation studies. We perform ablations in semantic segmentation on ADE20K <ref type="bibr" coords="8,136.56,83.30,14.94,7.77" target="#b56">[58]</ref> to verify the effectiveness of each of the proposed components in VPD and the influence of the different choices of cross-attention maps. We find that all the proposed components are beneficial and that combining the crossattention maps in the downsampling blocks and the upsampling blocks yields the best performance.</p><p>text blocks which do not change the spatial size. Finally, the upsampling blocks progressively increase the feature map size back to 64 × 64 and merge the information via some lateral connections from the downsampling blocks. The comparisons of leveraging the cross-attention maps from different locations can be found in the bottom part of Table <ref type="table" coords="8,87.96,335.56,3.74,8.64">5</ref>. First, we show that using the cross-attention maps from middle blocks might be harmful to the performance, mainly because the spatial resolution is too low to provide accurate information. Second, we find that the cross-attention maps from both the upsampling blocks and the downsampling blocks can bring considerable improvements and the upsampling blocks seem to be more beneficial to the performance. This is also reasonable because the cross-attention map will become more and more accurate during the forward procedure. Finally, we average both the cross-attention maps from the upsampling and downsampling blocks and demonstrate that they cooperate well and achieve better results in both mIoU@4K and mIoU@8K.</p><p>Effects of different pre-trained weights. Since our VPD is built on pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, it is necessary to investigate how the pre-trained weights would affect the performance of our VPD. In our previous experiments, we have used the released 1-5 version of the "Stable-Diffusion" (SD-1-5 for short). Now we compare different releases of "Stable-Diffusion" by applying the weights in the semantic segmentation on ADE20K <ref type="bibr" coords="8,267.28,584.96,15.27,8.64" target="#b56">[58]</ref>, and the results are illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="8,210.94,596.92,3.74,8.64" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. The differences between the checkpoints are the pre-training iterations on 512×512 resolution. We omit the SD-1-3 since it is trained for only 30K fewer iterations than SD-1-4. Our results in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="8,118.02,644.74,4.98,8.64" target="#fig_2">3</ref> demonstrate a clear trend that more pretrained iterations of the text-to-image diffusion model will also exhibit better performance on downstream tasks with VPD. It is worth noting that from SD-1-1 to SD-1-5, the mIoU@8K is improved by more than 4, which is quite considerable. We hypothesize that this is mainly because longer training can improve the alignment between visual and language, which can be also verified from the CLIP score of the different versions reported by the "Stable-Diffusion"<ref type="foot" coords="8,538.64,313.30,3.49,6.05" target="#foot_1">1</ref> . These results also show that the success of our method is based on the learned visual-language knowledge rather than the large capacity of the θ network. The upward trend in the graph demonstrates the scaling ability of our VPD, indicating that a stronger pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model can help us achieve better results.</p><p>Limitations. While our method has shown satisfactory performance, we acknowledge that the computational cost of VPD is currently relatively high. Unlike recognition models that are explicitly designed to balance efficiency and accuracy, generative models prioritize synthesis quality and often lack careful consideration of complexity. Although we have demonstrated the potential of extracting valuable information from a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, the high computational costs of θ cannot be addressed within our current framework. We believe that further improvements in the complexity-accuracy trade-offs of VPD can be achieved through a more lightweight design of the generative model or a more efficient architecture dedicated to both generative and perception tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we have proposed a new framework called VPD to transfer the high-level knowledge of a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to downstream tasks. We have proposed several designs to encourage visual-language alignment and prompt the pre-trained model implicitly and explicitly. Extensive experiments on semantic segmentation, referring image segmentation, and depth estimation have demonstrated that VPD can achieve very competitive performance and exhibits faster convergence compared to methods with various visual pre-training paradigms. We also believe that text-guided generative models other than diffusion models <ref type="bibr" coords="9,115.66,111.34,17.82,8.64" target="#b43">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,136.57,111.34,12.45,8.64" target="#b38">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,152.11,111.34,8.30,8.64" target="#b7">8]</ref> can also fit in VPD, which we leave to future work. We expect our efforts to shed light on the crucial role of generative text-to-image pre-training in visual perception and make a step towards the unification of visual generation and perception tasks.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="1,308.86,428.13,236.25,8.12;1,308.86,439.44,236.25,7.77;1,308.86,450.40,236.25,7.77;1,308.86,461.36,236.25,7.77;1,308.86,472.32,228.88,7.77"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

The overall framework of VPD. To better exploit the semantic knowledge learned from text-to-image generation pre-training, we prompt the denoising UNet with properly designed text prompts and employ the cross-attention maps to provide both implicit and explicit guidance to downstream visual perception tasks. Our framework can fully leverage both the low-level and high-level pre-trained knowledge and can be applied in a variety of visual perception tasks.</figDesc></figure>

		<title level="a" type="main">(2021) Volume 2, Issue 4 Cultural Implications of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC Authors: Dr. Unsa Jamshed Amar Jahangir Anbrin Khawaja Abstract: This study is an attempt to highlight the cultural implication of CPEC on Pak-China relations, how it will align two nations culturally, and what steps were taken by the governments of two states to bring the people closer. After the establishment of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and China, the cultural aspect of relations between the two states also moved forward. The flow of cultural delegations intensified after the 2010, because this year was celebrated as the ‘Pak-China Friendship Year’. This dimension of relations further cemented between the two states with the signing of CPEC in April 2015. CPEC will not only bring economic prosperity in Pakistan but it will also bring two states culturally closer. The roads and other communication link under this project will become source of cultural flow between the two states.

In this perspective, political figures frequently use twitter to highlight their political as well as personal lives worldwide. However, political figures take the stardom status among the twitter audience that follow, retweet and comment by their fans. The purpose of this study is, to analyze what kind of language, level of interest is made by political figures while communicating via twitter, text, phrases and languages used by political figures, and do their tweets contribute in their reputation. The qualitative content analysis is used for evaluation of the interests shared by PM Imran Khan, PM Boris John Son and PM Narendra Modi with the key words of tweets. A well-established coding sheet is developed for the analysis of text, phrases and words in the frames of negative, positive and neutral from March 2020 to May 2020. The results are demonstrating on the basis of content shared by Prime Ministers of three countries i.e., From Pakistan, Imran Khan, United Kingdom, Johnson Boris and India, Narendra Modi on twitter. The findings also reveal that varied issues discussed in tweets, significantly positive and neutral words are selected by these political figures. PM Imran tweeted more negative tweets than PM Boris Johnson and PM Narendra Modi. However, PM Boris Johnson and PM Narendra Modi make significant positive and neutral tweets. It is observed that political figures are conscious about their personal reputation while tweeting. It also revealed that the issues and tweets shared by these leaders contribute to their personal reputation.

However, this relationship becomes more questionable when policy uncertainty is added in it. Hence, this paper presents evidence on the effect of government size on economic growth in the presence of budget uncertainty measured through three different approaches. Rather than relying on the traditional and complicated measures of uncertainty, a new method of measuring uncertainty based on government budget revisions of total spending is introduced and compared with the other competing approaches. Using time series annual data from 1973-2018, the short run and long run coefficients from Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) framework validate the negative effect of budget uncertainty and government size on economic growth of Pakistan regardless of the uncertainty measure used. Therefore, to attain the long run economic growth, along with the control on the share of government spending in total GDP, government should keep the revisions in the budget as close to the initial announcements as it can so that uncertainty can be reduced. Further, the uncertainty in fiscal spending calculated through the deviation method raises a big question on the credibility of fiscal policy in Pakistan. Higher will be the deviation higher will be the uncertainty and lower the fiscal policy credibility hence making fiscal policy less effective in the long run.

The paper argues that The Alchemist is a cynical and despairing play created in an atmosphere not suitable for a comedy. This is a qualitative study of the text and aims at an analysis of the theme, situations, characters, language, and the mood of the play to determine that Jonson is unable to retain the comic spirit in The Alchemist and in an attempt to “better men” (Prologue. 12) he becomes more satirical and less humorous or comic. This research is important for it contends that the play, termed as a comedy, may be read as a bitter satire on the cynical, stinky, and despairing world of the Elizabethan times.

The Prince is the book of Niccolo Machiavelli a great philosopher of his time. If Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi qualifies as a Prince of Machiavelli is a very important question. This is answered in the light of his policies and strategies to become the undisputed political leader of India. Much of the Machiavellian Prince deals with the problem of how a layman can raise himself from abject and obscure origins to such a position that Narendra Modi has been holding in India since 2014. The basic theme of this article is revolving around the question that is following: Can Modi’s success be attributed to techniques of The Prince in important respects? This article analyzed Narendra Modi&apos;s policies and strategies to develop an analogy between Machiavellian Prince and Modi in terms of characteristics and political strategies.

This Lyotardian paradigm extends a subversive challenge to all the grand narratives that have been enjoying the status of an enviable complete code of life in the world for a long time. Even a cursory scan over the play under analysis creates a strong feel that Beckett very smartly, comprehensively and successfully questioned the relevance of the totalizing metanarratives to the present times. Being an imaginative writer, he was well aware of the fact that ridicule is a much more useful weapon than satire in the context of political literature. There are so many foundationalist ideologies that he ridicules in his dramatic writing. Christianity as a religion is well exposed; the gravity of philosophy is devalued; the traditional luxury that the humans get from the art of poetry is ruptured and the great ideals of struggle are punctured. He achieves his artistic and ideologically evolved authorial intentions with a ringing success. It is interesting to note that he maintains a healthy balance between art and message.

Kashmir is the unfinished agenda of partition and a stumbling block in the bilateral relations between Pakistan and India. After the partition of sub-continent in 1947, Pakistan and India got their sovereign status. Kashmir conflict, a disputed status state, is the byproduct of partition. Pakistan and India are traditional arch-foes. Any clash between Pakistan and India can bring the two nuclear states toe-to-toe and accelerate into nuclear warfare. Due to the revulsion, hostility and lack of trust between the two, the peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue has been long overdue. Ever-increasing border spats, arms race and threat of terrorism between the two have augmented anxiety in the subcontinent along with the halt of talks between India and Pakistan at several times. Additionally, it hampers the economic and trade ties between the two. India, time and again, backtracked on Kashmir issue despite UN efforts to resolve the issue. Recently, Indian government has responded heavy-handedly to the Kashmiri agitators’ demand for sovereignty and revocation of ‘Special Status’ of Kashmir impacting the stability of the region in future.

Data comprises the official discourse which is used in diplomatic affairs of both the states. The extensive investigation seeks insights from the fundamentals of Critical Discourse Analysis propounded by van Dijk, Fairclough and Wodak with a special focus on Bhatia’s (2006) work. The study reveals that the image of China has always been accorded priority within Indian and Pakistani diplomatic discourse even though nature of bilateral relations among China, India and Pakistan is based on entirely different dynamics; Indian and Pakistani diplomatic discourses are reflective of sensitivities involved within the bilateral relations. Through employment of linguistic techniques of ‘positivity’, ‘evasion’ and ‘influence and power’, Indian diplomats have managed not to compromise over the fundamentals in bilateral relations with China despite Pakistan’s already strengthened and deep-rooted relations with China. While Pakistani diplomatic fronts have been equally successful in further deepening their already strengthened relations in the midst of surging controversies on CPEC, BRI and OBOR. Hence, diplomatic fronts of both the counties, through employment of ideologically loaded linguistic choices, leave no stone unturned in consolidation of the diplomatic relations with China.

The shift in average temperature is putting negative impacts on human health, food production and the natural resources. In the wake of the altered climate, water flow in the river systems is experiencing variability and uncertainty. This paper aims at studying the negative impacts of climate change on the water resources of the Indus Basin and investigate the prospects of cooperation between India and Pakistan; two major riparian nations sharing the basin. Adopting the case study approach, a theoretical framework has been built on the ‘Theory of the International Regimes’. It has been argued that institutional capacity and the dispute resolution mechanism provided in any water sharing agreement determine the extent of cooperation among the member states. Since India and Pakistan are bound by the provisions of the Indus Waters Treaty, this study tries to assess the effectiveness of this agreement in managing the negative consequences of the climate change.

This needs a valid and reliable measure to assess the differentiation of self particularly in a relationship with parents. Behavior\Emotional Reactivity Index is such a tool that fulfills this purpose. The present study was carried out to culturaly adapt and translate BERI into the Urdu language and establish the psychometric properties of Urdu version. A sample of 303 adolescents of age (M = 16.07, SD = 1.77) was taken from different schools and colleges. Scale was split into Mother and father forms for the convenience of respondents. Findings supported the original factor structure of the BERI-original version. Higher-order factor analysis showed good fit indices with excellent alpha ranges (α= .91 to α=.80). BERI scores were compared for the adolescents who were securely attached with parents and insecurely attached with parents which showed a significant difference between the groups. BERI-Urdu version was found to be a valid and reliable measure in the Pakistani cultural context which gives researchers new directions to work with adolescents.

Courts were required to adopt new methods, techniques and devices obtained through advancement of science without affecting the original intention of law. Because of modern technology, a benefit could be taken from said technology to preserve evidences and to assist proceedings of the Court in the dispensation of justice in modern times. Owing to the scientific and technological advancements the admissibility of audio and visual proofs has grown doubtful. No doubt modern evidence assist the court in reaching out to the just decision but at the same time certain criteria need to be laid down which must be satisfied to consider such evidence admissible. Different Case laws are discussed here to show how the cases were resolved on the basis of technological evidence and when and why such evidence have been rejected by the court, if it did. Moreover, legal practices developed in various countries allow our Courts to record evidence through video conferencing. The Honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan directed that in appropriate cases statement of juvenile rape victims and other cases of sensitive nature must be recorded through video conferencing to avoid inconvenience for them to come to the Court. Nevertheless, it has some problems. The most important among them is the identification of the witness and an assurance that he is not being prompted when his statement is recorded.

The boundaries of geographies play a significant role in shaping fates, biographies, social superstructures and shared collective histories of its residents. Considering this, Henri Lefebvre and Edward William Soja, argue that space is something which determines the living circumstances within the particular social framework and instigates and controls various societal happenings. City space of Karachi suffers from appalling distortions as a part of postmodern, globalized and capitalist world. By employing Lefebvre’s idea of spatial triad and Soja’s views of the trialectrics of spaciality, this paper foregrounds how social space enforces spatial injustice and serves for the inculcation of spatial cleansing in the lives of inhabitants of urban space. Using Shamsie’s Kartography as an interpretive tool for contemporary urban environment, this paper inquires the engrafting of spatial cleansing in the lives of Karachiites resulting in multiple standardization and segregation on the basis of living standards among different social strata. This research substantiates how in Kartography, Materialism nibbles the roots of social values and norms while sequentially administering Spatial Injustice in the lives of Karachiites. This paper proclaims the scarcity of execution of Spatial Justice in the lives of common people in this postmodern globalized capitalist era. This paper urges the possibility of a utopian urban space with enforced spatial justice where people can be saved from dilemmas of injustice and segregation, especially Karachiites.

The entire Middle East region is fraught with tensions, conflicts, civil wars and rivalries. From strategic interests to power grabbing, sectarian divisions, flaws in the civil and social structure of the state and society, ethnic insurrections, and many other shapes of instability syndromes can be diagnosed in this region. In the post-Arab Spring, 2011, the emerging new regional hierarchical order for power/dominance, in addition to the weakening/declining dominant US power in the region, changed the entire shape of already conflict-ridden region. New weak or collapsing states and bifurcation of the ‘status quo’ and ‘counter-hegemonic’ states along with their respective allies, made this region a prototype of instability in the regional security complex of the Middle East, as a direct result of these developments. The perpetuation of these abnormalities would not recede this instability conundrum from the region, provoking third party intervention, if not contained.

The study concludes that the unaccusative verbs only project an internal argument. It does not require the event argument. However, the said verb can be causativised by adding external argument and at the same time the event argument gets included in the valency of the derived causative of the unaccusative root. The unergative, on the other hand, requires an external argument as an obligatory argument while the internal argument is not the obligatory argument of the verb. The event argument is also a part of the valency of the verb. The APFs require one argument which is the internal argument of the verb. However, since the external argument is not available, the internal argument of the verb gets realized as the subject of the verb. The verb does not project event argument. The ergative predicates are derived by the suppression of the external argument and by the externalization of the internal argument.

Its geo-strategic location affects its national identity as a nation state. Unlike Europe in South Asia security dilemma, proxy warfare and nuclear arms race are consistent features of the regional politics. The identity of Pakistan as security-centric state gives its army disproportional power, which created institutional imbalance that directly affected constitutionalism in the country. The constitution of Pakistan is based on principles of civilian supremacy and separation of power but in reality Pakistan’s army is the most powerful institution in country. This paper argues that the structure of Pakistani politics; created institutional imbalances by the disproportionate distribution of resources is the key variable in creating dichotomy. The structure of domestic politics is based upon the principles of hostility to India, use of Islam for national unity and strategic alliances with major powers to finance defense against the neighboring countries.

Those places were replaced by commercial or residential sites. There is also a graveyard in the city which is in the use of Hindu Valmik Sect. However, it was encroached by some Muslims due to very small size of population and indolence of the Hindus. Later on, the encroachments were removed by the District Government Lahore in compliance of order of the Supreme Court of Pakistan. Presently, there is a graveyard as well as a crematorium in the city.

In this study six growth models have been used for analyzing the main determinants of economic growth in case of cross countries, therefore by using these six models we have tested them for non-nested and nested encompassing through Cox test and F-test respectively. Data from 1980 to 2020 were used to analyze the cross country growth factors so therefore, the current study looked at about forty four countries with modelling these different comparative studies based on growth modelling. So, we can make these six individual models and we can estimate the General Unrestricted Model with the use of econometric technique of Non-Nested Encompassing. By evaluating the data using the Non-Nested Encompassing econometric technique, different sets of economic variables has been used to evaluate which sets of the economic variables are important to boost up the growth level of the country.

Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) was adopted as a theoretical framework. A total of 250 young consumers in the two cities of Southern Punjab, Pakistan was randomly sampled and data were collected via a face-to-face survey method. Partial least square technique was employed to test the model. The results showed that attitude towards organic food purchasing motivated when moral norms were activated to consume organic food products. Further, environmental knowledge moderated the relationship of organic food purchase intentions and behaviour significantly. The findings highlighted the importance of moral norms as a meaningful antecedent that could increase the TP-based psychosocial processes if consumers have sufficient environmental knowledge. Therefore, farmers, organic products marketers, government administrators, and food retailers should take initiatives not only to highlight the norms and values but also when promoting organic food production and consumption.

The study under research examines the perspectives of two similar groups of the final year students of at Higher Education Institutions of Pakistan. The first group consists of art students who received the Urdu medium of instruction (UMI), and the second group received the English medium of instruction (EMI). An empirical methodology was carried out in the present year, students answered questionnaires to find out the benefits and challenges of learning subject-based knowledge, what subject-based knowledge means to them, and their understanding of language as a teaching language. Interviews were conducted with the selected group of students who wished to participate in research. Additional information is available from the tests and results obtained in the two equivalent courses. Although many similarities have been identified between the two groups, the overall knowledge of disciplinary knowledge of English medium instruction students was not very effective, while that of UMI students was very effective. It explains the implications of the findings to continue the language rule as policy experience for teaching in higher education institutions.

Ecofeminism critiques masculine dominance highlighting its role in creating and perpetuating gender discrimination, social inequity and environmental degradation. Women suffer more because of power disparity in society. Environmental crises affect women more than men because of their already precarious existence and subaltern position. There is affinity between women and nature are victims of climate change and other environmental hazards. Cheryl Glotfelty introduced interdisciplinary approach to the study of literature and environment. Literary ecology as an emerging discipline explores the intriguing relationship between environment and literature. Ecofeminism draws on feminist critique of gender inequality showing how gender categories inscribed in power structure exploit both women and nature. Francoise d‘Eaubonne coined the term ecofeminism to critique the prevalent exploitation of both women and environment. Ecofeminism asserts that exploitation of women and degradation of the environment are the direct result of male dominance and capitalism. Ecofeminism argues for redressing the plight of women and protection of environment. Vonnegut’s play ‘Happy Birthday Wanda June’ was written at a time when the movement for the right of women and protection of environment were gaining momentum.

Understanding qawwali context requires comprehension of semantics or process of meaning creation and meaning sharing among the qawwal party and the audience. This interactive activity might frequently be hindered when interrupted by subjective meanings creation during cultural consumption. Qawwali is a cultural tradition, its semantics are conditioned by axiological premises of poetry and perceptions which are transforming. The previous researches revealed that qawwali is associated with religion which provides the religious message by singing hamd and naat. It was a means to experience Divine; therefore, semantics are multi-layered and often crossroad with values and subjective experiences. It is novel due to its ritual of Sama. It has the therapeutic power that helps mentally disturbed people and they find refuge. This study is exploratory having a small sample size of twenty purposively selected audiences. This phenomenological inquiry used ethnographic method of conversational interviews at selected shrines and cultural spaces in Islamabad. The results indicate that qawwali is a strong refuge for people facing miseries of life and they attend Sama with a belief that attending and listening will consequently resolve their issues, either psychological or physiological. They participate in Sama which teaches them how to be optimistic in a negative situation; this paper brings forth this nodal phenomenon using the verbatim explanations by the interlocutors. Semantics of Qawwali are conditioned and some of these elements are highlighted including poetry and axiology based perceptions and cultural consumption of a cultural realm.

The Kafkaesque is characterised by the following: World is a huge forking labyrinthine institution where the man has been thrown to suffer its complexities, confrontation with the labyrinth makes his existence meaningless because freedom is a taboo in no man’s land, he is punished for an unknown sin for which he seeks justification from the superior authorities, but his efforts are viewed as ludicrous or comic despite the underlying sense of tragedy. (5) The Kafkaesque tendency to present tragic situation comically is also explored in Abe’s novel. The paper studies the effect of higher authorities exercising their power over man and the inscrutability of cosmic structures continuously undermining human freedom in nightmarish conditions. The paper establishes Kobo Abe in the literary world as a writer who portrays the hollowness and futility of human lives with a Kafkaesque touch.

Althusser believes that ideology is a belief system of a society in which ideological agencies establish hierarchies in society through reinforcement and discrimination for cultural conditioning. These agencies function through ideological state apparatuses. These ideological agencies help to construct individual identity in society. The undesirable ideologies promote repressive political agendas. The non-repressive ideologies are inhaled by the individuals as a natural way of looking at the culture and society. This research seeks to investigate Omar Shahid Hamid’s novel The Spinners Tales through the lens of Althusser’s ideology and interpellation. This study examines how the characters of Shahid’s novel inhaled ideology and became its subjects.

It controlled the Indian education field till the establishment of Indian Education Commission, 1882. The Despatch provided space to Christian missionaries by promising government’s gradual withdrawal from the education in favour of missionaries. It also facilitated the missionaries by offering system of ‘grants on aid’ to the private bodies. Consequently, the missionaries fancied to replace the government institutions in the Punjab and initiated their efforts to increase the number of their educational institutions. They tried to occupy the educational field by establishing more and more educational institutions. But after the Recommendations of the Indian Education Commission 1882, a change in their policy of numeric increase of educational institutions is quite visible. With the turn of the century, they are found to be eager to establish a few institutions with good quality of education. This paper intends to analyse different factors behind the change of their policy of quantitative dominance to qualitative improvement. It also attempts to evaluate how their change of policy worked and what steps were taken to improve the quality of their educational institutions. Following the historical method qualitative data comprising educational reports, missionaries’ autobiographies, Reports of missionaries’ conferences, and the other relevant primary and secondary sources has been collected from different repositories. The analysis of the data suggests that the attitude of the administration of the education department and the recommendations of Indian Education Commission were the major driving forces behind the change of missionaries’ educational policy in the 20th century.

Descriptive research was used by the researchers. The study was carried out by using Morris&apos;s Ways to Live Scale. Researchers used this scale to study prospective special education teachers&apos; gender, social status, personal relationships, aesthetics and mental approach using purposive sampling method. Descriptive and inferential stats were used to analyse the data collected from those who participated in the study on basic life values of prospective teachers. Results indicated that being social and sympathetic are the most important values among prospective special education teachers. It was also found that male and female prospective special education teachers living in urban and rural areas had no significant differences in their basic life values.

Daughters became curses and liability for parents causing serious consequences. For control, there are legal ban/restrictions (Dowry and Wedding Gifts (Restriction) Act, 1976; Amendment in Act, 1993) on its practice in Pakistan. Despite the legal cover, the custom has been extended. Dowry amount seems to be increasing due to changing lifestyle and trends of society. To understand males’ and females’ perceptions about dowry; impacts of dowry; why dowry is essential; and how it is affecting women’s rights and eventually affecting women’s autonomy. A qualitative study was conducted. Data was collected by using unstructured interviews from males and females including social activists, economists, and married couples about wedding expenses, demands, society pressure, men’s support, and perception against dowry especially with regards to women’s rights and autonomy. The study concluded heavy dowry especially in terms of furniture, electronics, kitchenware, car, furnished houses, and cash highly associated with women’s development and their rights. General people’s perception showed that dowry is no longer remained a custom or tradition in Asian countries. It is just a trend and people follow it as a symbol of respect for parents and women as well.

Lack of capacity and poor standards of governance caused nontraditional security challenges to Pakistan too. The NCOC is the central nerve center to guide the national response to COVID-19 by Pakistan and can be best analyzed in the light of the decision-making theory of Naturalist Decision Making (NDM). The study points out the effective role performed by NCOC at policy formation through a more prosaic combination of science, data, decision making and execution of decisions at the level of federalism. The study highlights the changing patterns of government’s approach during the pandemic at various levels. Pakistan faced economic, political and social crisis during this phase. This study uses a survey and key informant interviews as the source of analysis for qualitative data collection. By applying the decision- making theory, the paper extends that there is a need to use a model to balance the existing gap within the system, to meet challenges. The study suggests a coordinating approach among various units and center; that might raise the level of performance to meet the nontraditional security challenges with innovation, creativity and boldness.

Judicial review is a remedy provided by the public law and is exercised by the superior and higher courts to supervise administrative authorities&apos; powers and functions. The main objective of the judicial review is to ensure the fair and transparent treatment of individuals by public authorities. The ground of the judicial review, i.e., Unreasonableness or irrationality or popularly known as Wednesbury Unreasonableness was introduced by lord Greene in the Wednesbury Corporation case in 1948. Initially, the scope of this ground of judicial review was very narrow and was allowed only in rare cases. However, with the development of administrative law and Human rights, it also developed. Its development resulted in different controversies and issues about the application of this ground. The main issue is about its encroachment in the jurisdiction of other branches of the government i.e., the parliament and executive. The free and loose application of this principle results in confusion and conflict between different organs of the government. The present paper is based on the implications of the limitations on the ground of Wednesbury Unreasonableness both on the judicial and administrative bodies in Pakistan to avoid the chaos and confusion that results in the criticisms on this ground of judicial review.
