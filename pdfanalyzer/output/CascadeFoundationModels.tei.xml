<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Visual recognition in low-data regimes requires deep neural networks to learn generalized representations from limited training samples. Recently, CLIP-based methods have shown promising few-shot performance benefited from the contrastive language-image pre-training. We then question, if the more diverse pre-training knowledge can be cascaded to further assist few-shot representation learning. In this paper, we propose CaFo, a Cascade of Foundation models that incorporates diverse prior knowledge of various pretraining paradigms for better few-shot learning. Our CaFo incorporates CLIP's language-contrastive knowledge, DINO's vision-contrastive knowledge, DALL-E's visiongenerative knowledge, and GPT-3's language-generative knowledge. Specifically, CaFo works by 'Prompt, Generate, then Cache'. Firstly, we leverage GPT-3 to produce textual inputs for prompting CLIP with rich downstream linguistic semantics. Then, we generate synthetic images via DALL-E to expand the few-shot training data without any manpower. At last, we introduce a learnable cache model to adaptively blend the predictions from CLIP and DINO. By such collaboration, CaFo can fully unleash the potential of different pre-training methods and unify them to perform state-ofthe-art for few-shot classification. Code is available at https://github.com/ZrrSkywalker/CaFo.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Convolutional neural networks <ref type="bibr" coords="1,199.92,659.78,16.60,8.64" target="#b42">[42]</ref> and transformers <ref type="bibr" coords="1,64.73,671.73,16.60,8.64" target="#b67">[67]</ref> have attained great success on a wide range of vision tasks with abundant datasets <ref type="bibr" coords="1,189.86,683.69,15.27,8.64" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Instead, for some * Equal contribution. † Corresponding author data-deficient and resource-finite scenarios, few-shot learning <ref type="bibr" coords="1,323.94,525.19,15.77,8.64" target="#b62">[62,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,340.74,525.19,13.28,8.64" target="#b69">69]</ref> also becomes a research hotspot, where the networks are constrained to learn from limited images with annotations. Many previous works have been proposed in this field to enhance model's generalization capability by meta learning <ref type="bibr" coords="1,382.67,573.01,15.77,8.64" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,400.71,573.01,11.83,8.64" target="#b70">70]</ref>, metric learning <ref type="bibr" coords="1,486.78,573.01,15.27,8.64" target="#b73">[73]</ref>, and data augmentation <ref type="bibr" coords="1,367.73,584.96,15.77,8.64" target="#b28">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,386.23,584.96,11.83,8.64" target="#b72">72]</ref>. Recently, CLIP <ref type="bibr" coords="1,480.18,584.96,16.60,8.64" target="#b56">[56]</ref> pre-trained by large-scale language-image pairs shows favorable zeroshot transfer ability for open-vocabulary visual recognition. The follow-up CoOp <ref type="bibr" coords="1,425.36,620.83,15.27,8.64" target="#b81">[81]</ref>, CLIP-Adapter <ref type="bibr" coords="1,510.04,620.83,16.60,8.64" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and Tip-Adapter <ref type="bibr" coords="1,361.42,632.78,16.60,8.64" target="#b75">[75]</ref> further extend it for few-shot classification and achieve superior performance on various downstream datasets. This indicates that, even if the few-shot training data is insufficient, the large-scale pre-training has endowed the network with strong representation ability, which highly benefits the few-shot learning on downstream domains. Now that there exist various self-supervisory paradigms besides CLIP, could we adaptively integrate their pre-learned knowledge and collaborate them to be a better few-shot learner?</p><p>To tackle this issue, we propose CaFo, a Cascade of Fooundation models blending the knowledge from multiple pre-training paradigms with a 'Prompt, Generate, then Cache' pipeline. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,244.72,149.10,3.74,8.64" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, we integrate CLIP <ref type="bibr" coords="2,108.08,161.06,15.27,8.64" target="#b56">[56]</ref>, DINO <ref type="bibr" coords="2,162.04,161.06,10.58,8.64" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, DALL-E <ref type="bibr" coords="2,221.69,161.06,15.27,8.64" target="#b57">[57]</ref>, and GPT-3 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,58.82,173.01,11.62,8.64" target="#b3">[4]</ref> to provide four types of prior knowledge for CaFo. Therein, CLIP <ref type="bibr" coords="2,114.00,184.97,16.60,8.64" target="#b56">[56]</ref> is pre-trained to produce paired features in the embedding space for every image and its descriptive text. Guided by texts with different categorical semantics, CLIP <ref type="bibr" coords="2,143.28,220.83,16.60,8.64" target="#b56">[56]</ref> can well classify the images aided by language-contrastive knowledge. DINO follows contrastive self-supervised learning <ref type="bibr" coords="2,219.54,244.74,11.62,8.64" target="#b6">[7]</ref> to match the representations between two transformations of one same image, which is expert at distinguishing different images with vision-contrastive knowledge. Similar to CLIP <ref type="bibr" coords="2,267.27,280.61,15.27,8.64" target="#b56">[56]</ref>, DALL-E <ref type="bibr" coords="2,89.85,292.56,16.60,8.64" target="#b57">[57]</ref> is also pre-trained by image-text pairs but learns to predict the encoded image tokens based on the given text tokens. Conditioned on the input text, DALL-E <ref type="bibr" coords="2,59.14,328.43,16.60,8.64" target="#b57">[57]</ref> could leverage the vision-generative knowledge to create high-quality synthetic images in a zero-shot manner. Pre-trained by large-scale language corpus, GPT-3 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,252.11,352.34,11.62,8.64" target="#b3">[4]</ref> takes a few hand-written templates as input, and autoregressively generates human-like texts, which contain rich languagegenerative knowledge. Therefore, the four models have distinctive pre-training goals and can provide complementary knowledge to assist the few-shot visual recognition.</p><p>In detail, we cascade them by three steps.: 1) Prompt. We adopt GPT-3 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,121.68,437.92,11.62,8.64" target="#b3">[4]</ref> to produce textual prompts for CLIP based on a few hand-written templates. These prompts with richer language knowledge are fed into CLIP's textual encoder. 2) Generate. We adopt DALL-E <ref type="bibr" coords="2,228.34,473.78,16.60,8.64" target="#b57">[57]</ref> to generate additional training images for different categories based on the domain-specific texts, which enlarges the few-shot training data, but costs no extra manpower for collection and annotation. 3) Cache. We utilize a cache model to adaptively incorporate the predictions from both CLIP <ref type="bibr" coords="2,269.77,533.56,16.60,8.64" target="#b56">[56]</ref> and DINO <ref type="bibr" coords="2,97.60,545.51,10.58,8.64" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Referring to Tip-Adapter <ref type="bibr" coords="2,226.77,545.51,15.27,8.64" target="#b75">[75]</ref>, we build the cache model with two kinds of keys respectively for the two pre-trained models. Regarding zero-shot CLIP as the distribution baseline, we adaptively ensemble the predictions of two cached keys as the final output. By only fine-tuning the lightweight cache model via expanded training data, CaFo can learn to fuse diverse prior knowledge and leverage their complementary characteristics for better few-shot visual recognition.</p><p>Our main contributions are summarized as follows:</p><p>• We propose CaFo to incorporate the prior knowledge learned from various pre-training paradigms for better few-shot learning.</p><p>• By collaborating CLIP, DINO, GPT-3 and DALL-E, CaFo utilizes more semantic prompts, enriches the limited few-shot training data, and adaptively ensembles diverse predictions via the cache model.</p><p>• We conduct thorough experiments on 11 datasets for few-shot classification, where CaFo achieves state-ofthe-art without using extra annotated data.</p></div>

In addition, visionlanguage pre-training can also promote the zero-shot image generation from text. Open generative models, such as DALL-E <ref type="bibr" coords="2,360.41,474.03,16.60,8.64" target="#b57">[57]</ref> and CogView <ref type="bibr" coords="2,440.27,474.03,16.60,8.64" target="#b15">[16]</ref> pre-trained on largescale image-text pairs are able to generate images with diverse contents by given texts. In this paper, CaFo cascade three visual pre-training models, CLIP, DINO, and DALL-E, which contributes to better few-shot learning capacity.</p><p>Language-assisted Vision Models. As different form of data, linguistic knowledge normally contains complementary knowledge to images. For vision-language models, several works <ref type="bibr" coords="2,365.34,584.96,12.73,8.64" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,378.07,584.96,12.73,8.64" target="#b23">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,390.79,584.96,12.73,8.64" target="#b56">56]</ref> have showed the format of prompts would highly affect the accuracy on vision tasks. Thus, prompt engineering is worth putting in great effort. Some efforts <ref type="bibr" coords="2,336.68,620.83,17.13,8.64" target="#b37">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,353.81,620.83,12.85,8.64" target="#b59">59,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,366.65,620.83,12.85,8.64" target="#b78">78,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,379.50,620.83,12.85,8.64" target="#b82">82]</ref> utilize learnable textual inputs and optimize them during training. Other works <ref type="bibr" coords="2,479.86,632.78,15.77,8.64" target="#b48">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,497.27,632.78,13.28,8.64" target="#b55">55]</ref> propose to leverage linguistic knowledge pre-trained from large language models to generate prompts for each visual category, which enhances vision-language models without any additional training or labeling. Our CaFo refers to CuPL <ref type="bibr" coords="2,518.36,680.60,16.60,8.64" target="#b55">[55]</ref> to produce semantic-rich texts to prompt CLIP for better textimage alignment.</p><p>Few-shot Learning. Few-shot learning highly relies on the transferability of the trained neural networks. From the perspective of distance measurement, some metric learning methods learn a metric space by computing the distances from the instances to novel categories <ref type="bibr" coords="3,210.16,123.30,15.77,8.64" target="#b62">[62,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,228.03,123.30,12.45,8.64" target="#b64">64,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,242.58,123.30,11.83,8.64" target="#b69">69]</ref>. Also, meta-learning is proposed to improve the few-shot adaptation ability of the models by finding a set of initialized parameters that can rapidly adapt to novel domains <ref type="bibr" coords="3,244.02,159.16,16.94,8.64" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,260.96,159.16,12.70,8.64" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,273.66,159.16,12.70,8.64" target="#b38">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,50.11,171.12,11.83,8.64" target="#b43">43]</ref>. More recently, with the vision-language pre-training model CLIP <ref type="bibr" coords="3,100.48,183.07,16.60,8.64" target="#b56">[56]</ref> exhibiting strong zero-shot adaptation performance, several efforts have started to find efficient strategies to adapt it to downstream few-shot datasets. CoOp <ref type="bibr" coords="3,269.77,206.98,16.60,8.64" target="#b81">[81]</ref> is proposed as a prompt tuning adaptation method by optimizing a set of learnable prompt tokens. Subsequently, to inject textual branch with visual signals, CoCoOp <ref type="bibr" coords="3,269.77,242.85,16.60,8.64" target="#b83">[83]</ref> and VT-CLIP <ref type="bibr" coords="3,107.69,254.80,16.60,8.64" target="#b78">[78]</ref> propose to train a intermediate network to generate image tokens as conditional inputs for the textual vectors. Referring to adapters <ref type="bibr" coords="3,204.47,278.72,16.60,8.64" target="#b36">[36]</ref> in natural language processing, CLIP-Adapter <ref type="bibr" coords="3,183.95,290.67,16.60,8.64" target="#b21">[22]</ref> is introduced to finetune CLIP by applying lightweight residual-style adapters. Tip-Adapter <ref type="bibr" coords="3,102.24,314.58,16.60,8.64" target="#b75">[75]</ref> is then proposed as a training-free adaption method with a constructed key-value cache model. It can also be regarded as a better initialization of CLIP-Adapter with much faster convergence when fine-tuning. CALIP <ref type="bibr" coords="3,81.37,362.40,16.60,8.64" target="#b27">[27]</ref> proposes a parameter-free attention to enhance CLIP in a zero-shot manner, and its parametric solution further attains higher few-shot accuracy. SuS-X <ref type="bibr" coords="3,248.79,386.31,16.60,8.64" target="#b65">[65]</ref> constructs a dynamic support set and extends Tip-Adapter by leveraging image-text distances. Besides, many follow-up works <ref type="bibr" coords="3,78.03,422.18,15.77,8.64" target="#b37">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,95.88,422.18,12.45,8.64" target="#b45">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,110.42,422.18,12.45,8.64" target="#b65">65,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,124.95,422.18,12.45,8.64" target="#b74">74,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,139.49,422.18,12.45,8.64" target="#b77">77,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,154.02,422.18,12.45,8.64" target="#b80">80,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,168.56,422.18,13.28,8.64" target="#b84">84]</ref> have also been proposed for further adapting CLIP to various vision tasks. Different from all existing methods, we integrate other powerful pretraining paradigms with CLIP and collaborate them with customized pipelines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Cascade of Foundation Models</head><p>In this section, we first briefly revisit four types of pretraining paradigms in CaFo. Then, we specifically introduce how we cascade them by 'Prompt, Generate, then Cache'.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Different Pre-training Paradigms</head><p>Contrastive Vision-Language Pre-training. The series <ref type="bibr" coords="3,69.32,596.92,11.62,8.64" target="#b8">[9]</ref> of contrastive learning between vision and language learn to map the two modalities into the same embedding space via a contrastive loss. Driven by web-scale datasets, e.g., 400 million for CLIP <ref type="bibr" coords="3,194.40,632.78,16.60,8.64" target="#b56">[56]</ref> and 1.8 billion for ALIGN <ref type="bibr" coords="3,83.29,644.74,15.27,8.64" target="#b39">[39]</ref>, the basic pre-training target is to minimize the embedding distances of images and their textual descriptions, while maximize those unpaired ones. By the crossmodal alignment, we can discriminate images of different categorizes by the texts with different semantics. We denote such learned prior as language-contrastive knowledge Contrastive Vision Pre-training. As the traditional selfsupervised learning methods, vision-contrastive models <ref type="bibr" coords="3,533.50,311.42,11.62,8.64" target="#b8">[9]</ref> focus on the discrimination between different images. Normally, the positive pairs to be drawn close are two transformations of the same image, while the optimization of negative pairs <ref type="bibr" coords="3,368.88,359.24,16.60,8.64" target="#b24">[24]</ref> is optional, which can be replaced by a momentum encoder <ref type="bibr" coords="3,399.39,371.20,16.60,8.64" target="#b31">[31]</ref> or cluster assignments <ref type="bibr" coords="3,511.81,371.20,10.58,8.64" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Recent works reveal that we can learn self-supervised features without negative pairs between images <ref type="bibr" coords="3,489.21,395.11,10.79,8.64" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,501.48,395.11,11.83,8.64" target="#b25">25]</ref>. Given the strong linear classification capacity, the pre-trained DINO <ref type="bibr" coords="3,338.81,419.02,11.62,8.64" target="#b6">[7]</ref> is adopted here to provide vision-contrastive knowledge for collaboration.</p><p>Generative Language Pre-training. With 175 billion parameters, the large-scale pre-trained GPT-3 <ref type="bibr" coords="3,499.14,466.13,11.62,8.64" target="#b3">[4]</ref> is powerful to produce human-like texts with diverse contents and incredible quality. Taking as input a few designed language commands, GPT-3 is able to output prompts with rich linguistic semantics for vision-language models. CLIP utilizes handcrafted templates as prompts, e.g., "a photo of a [CLASS]", which however lacks sufficient textual semantics to align with input images. We thus leverage GPT-3 to produce CLIP's prompts to better align with visual information from images.</p><p>Generative Vision-Language Pre-training. Learned from millions of image-caption pairs, the DALL-E series can generate language-conditioned images in a zero-shot manner. They are pre-trained to autoregressively predict the encoded image tokens from the textual tokens of the captions. With such language-generative knowledge, the pre-trained DALL-E can be viewed as a free lunch to enlarge the training data without any manpower. Considering publicity, we select DALL-E-mini <ref type="bibr" coords="3,446.18,692.56,16.60,8.64" target="#b13">[14]</ref> as the representative among DALL-E models. , then Cache by CLIP <ref type="bibr" coords="4,280.33,261.91,14.94,8.06" target="#b56">[56]</ref> and DINO <ref type="bibr" coords="4,341.78,261.91,9.52,8.06" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. We adopt DALL-E to generate synthetic images to expand the limited few-shot training samples. Then, we construct the cache model with two kinds of keys to adaptively fuse the knowledge from CLIP and DINO.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Prompt, Generate, then Cache</head><p>To cascade different pre-training paradigms, we introduce CaFo with a pipeline of 'Prompt, Generate, then Cache', which respectively unleashes the powers of different self-supervised knowledge.</p><p>Prompt with GPT-3. Under the N -way K-shot settings, we have the few-shot training images I N,K with labels L N,K that contain K samples for each N categories. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,117.36,436.95,3.74,8.64" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, for N categories, we adopt a unified series of templates as the language command for GPT-3 <ref type="bibr" coords="4,272.26,448.90,10.58,8.64" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, e.g., "What a [CLASS] looks like?", "How can you identify a [CLASS]?", and "A caption of an image of a [CLASS]:". We denote the created prompts for N categories as P N , formulated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="4,113.57,519.57,172.80,9.65">P N = GPT-3(Commands).<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Then, we adopt P N as the input of CLIP's textual encoder.</p><p>Further, for some downstream data with specialized categories, we can customize the language commands for producing prompts with more domain-specific semantics. For example, in OxfordPets <ref type="bibr" coords="4,145.31,590.87,16.60,8.64" target="#b53">[53]</ref> dataset of pet images, we adopt the input of GPT-3 as "This is a pet bulldog, it has thin neck, short face, floppy ears. It's coat is short, straight, and in brindle color. This is a pet [CLASS],". Based on that, GPT-3 continues to describe more details of the [CLASS] pet.</p></div>

For different categories, we adopt a simple template, e.g., "a photo of </p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="4,346.55,373.13,198.56,9.96">I N,(K+K ) = {DALL-E(T N ), I N,K }, ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where T N denotes the N -category textual inputs. We keep K comparable with K to ensure the synthesis quality and also preserve the low-data regimes. By the pre-trained language-generative knowledge, the data expansion is totally zero-shot, which requires no manpower to collect or annotate the data, and alleviates the data deficiency issue inherently for few-shot learning.</p><p>Cache by CLIP and DINO. We construct a key-value cache model for adaptive knowledge ensemble. Different from Tip-Adapter <ref type="bibr" coords="4,381.01,516.31,16.60,8.64" target="#b75">[75]</ref> only adapting CLIP, our cache model contains the pre-learned knowledge from both CLIP and DINO by caching two kinds of keys. Specifically in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,324.31,552.17,4.98,8.64" target="#fig_4">4</ref> (2), we first utilize CLIP and DINO to independently extract visual features of the few-shot training images, formulated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="4,367.15,596.64,177.96,9.96">F CLIP = CLIP vis (I N,(K+K ) );<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="4,364.83,611.59,180.28,9.96">F DINO = DINO(I N,(K+K ) ),<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where CLIP vis denotes the CLIP's visual encoder and  </p><formula xml:id="formula_4" coords="4,308.86,642.85,125.76,11.38">F CLIP , F DINO ∈ R N (K+K )×C .</formula><formula xml:id="formula_5" coords="5,178.90,72.72,352.20,144.78">𝑳 1,4 𝜑 • 𝑓 !"#$ 𝜑 • 𝑓 %#&amp;' 𝑝 !"#$ 𝑝 %#&amp;' 𝑝 () reweight reweight CLIP 𝑤 !"#$ 𝑤 %#&amp;' 𝐸𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑚𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑑 𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑡𝑠 Cache Model</formula></div>

By this, we can suppress some obviously false category possibilities in p CLIP , p DINO and also amplify the moderately correct ones during ensemble. Firstly, we respectively normalize the scales of three classification logits into -1∼1 by their each mean and standard deviation. We then calculate the distribution similarities as the ensemble weights for the two logits of the cache as</p><formula xml:id="formula_9" coords="5,87.05,635.11,199.32,12.85">w CLIP = p CLIP p T ZS ; w DINO = p DINO p T ZS .<label>(8)</label></formula><p>Finally, we adopt the softmax function to normalize the weights and obtain the final ensemble logits as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10" coords="5,99.81,691.44,186.55,19.91">p en = p ZS + i p i • softmax(w i ),<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where i ∈ {CLIP, DINO}. By such similarity-based ensemble, p en can adaptively fuse the prior knowledge learned by CLIP and DINO's pre-training and achieve stronger fewshot image classification.</p></div>

We first incorporate the generative language model, GPT-3, for prompting CLIP with more semantic texts, and adopt DALL-E to expand the few-shot training data. Then, we adaptively fuse the visioncontrastive DINO with CLIP via a unified cache model. By collaboration, CaFo achieves state-of-the-art performance for few-shot learning on 11 datasets.

		<title level="a" type="main">(2021) Volume 2, Issue 4 Cultural Implications of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC Authors: Dr. Unsa Jamshed Amar Jahangir Anbrin Khawaja Abstract: This study is an attempt to highlight the cultural implication of CPEC on Pak-China relations, how it will align two nations culturally, and what steps were taken by the governments of two states to bring the people closer. After the establishment of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and China, the cultural aspect of relations between the two states also moved forward. The flow of cultural delegations intensified after the 2010, because this year was celebrated as the ‘Pak-China Friendship Year’. This dimension of relations further cemented between the two states with the signing of CPEC in April 2015. CPEC will not only bring economic prosperity in Pakistan but it will also bring two states culturally closer. The roads and other communication link under this project will become source of cultural flow between the two states.

In this perspective, political figures frequently use twitter to highlight their political as well as personal lives worldwide. However, political figures take the stardom status among the twitter audience that follow, retweet and comment by their fans. The purpose of this study is, to analyze what kind of language, level of interest is made by political figures while communicating via twitter, text, phrases and languages used by political figures, and do their tweets contribute in their reputation. The qualitative content analysis is used for evaluation of the interests shared by PM Imran Khan, PM Boris John Son and PM Narendra Modi with the key words of tweets. A well-established coding sheet is developed for the analysis of text, phrases and words in the frames of negative, positive and neutral from March 2020 to May 2020. The results are demonstrating on the basis of content shared by Prime Ministers of three countries i.e., From Pakistan, Imran Khan, United Kingdom, Johnson Boris and India, Narendra Modi on twitter. The findings also reveal that varied issues discussed in tweets, significantly positive and neutral words are selected by these political figures. PM Imran tweeted more negative tweets than PM Boris Johnson and PM Narendra Modi. However, PM Boris Johnson and PM Narendra Modi make significant positive and neutral tweets. It is observed that political figures are conscious about their personal reputation while tweeting. It also revealed that the issues and tweets shared by these leaders contribute to their personal reputation.

However, this relationship becomes more questionable when policy uncertainty is added in it. Hence, this paper presents evidence on the effect of government size on economic growth in the presence of budget uncertainty measured through three different approaches. Rather than relying on the traditional and complicated measures of uncertainty, a new method of measuring uncertainty based on government budget revisions of total spending is introduced and compared with the other competing approaches. Using time series annual data from 1973-2018, the short run and long run coefficients from Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) framework validate the negative effect of budget uncertainty and government size on economic growth of Pakistan regardless of the uncertainty measure used. Therefore, to attain the long run economic growth, along with the control on the share of government spending in total GDP, government should keep the revisions in the budget as close to the initial announcements as it can so that uncertainty can be reduced. Further, the uncertainty in fiscal spending calculated through the deviation method raises a big question on the credibility of fiscal policy in Pakistan. Higher will be the deviation higher will be the uncertainty and lower the fiscal policy credibility hence making fiscal policy less effective in the long run.

The paper argues that The Alchemist is a cynical and despairing play created in an atmosphere not suitable for a comedy. This is a qualitative study of the text and aims at an analysis of the theme, situations, characters, language, and the mood of the play to determine that Jonson is unable to retain the comic spirit in The Alchemist and in an attempt to “better men” (Prologue. 12) he becomes more satirical and less humorous or comic. This research is important for it contends that the play, termed as a comedy, may be read as a bitter satire on the cynical, stinky, and despairing world of the Elizabethan times.

Pakistan and Afghanistan being immediate states have inter-connected future with socio-economic and security prospects. Principles of Coordinated Border Management (CBM) approach have been extracted on the basis of in-depth interviews with security agencies and policymakers to understand the real time needs. The current research employs mixed method approach. Process Tracing is employed in this research to comprehend the causal mechanism behind the contemporary issue of border management system. A detailed statistical analysis of prospect outcomes has been given to validate the implication of CBM. Implication range of CBM has been discussed with positive and probably negative impacts due to its wide range of significance. This research gives an analysis of feasibility support to exercise CBM in best interest of the state and secure future of the region.

With the application of containment Policy, the U.S. achieved much success in international politics. Over time China has become more powerful and sees great power in international politics. China wants to expand and launched the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The primary purpose of The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is to achieve support from regional countries and save their interests from the U.S. In 2017, the American administration launched its Containment policy through Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (the Quad) to keep their interest from China. The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) is comprising of Australia, the United States, Japan, and India. This Study is based on Qualitative research with theoretical application of Game theory. This research investigates both plans of China (BRI) and the U.S. (the Quad) through a Game Theory. In this study, China and the U.S. both like to act as gamers in international politics. This study recommends that Game theory can predict all developments in the long term.

The Prince is the book of Niccolo Machiavelli a great philosopher of his time. If Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi qualifies as a Prince of Machiavelli is a very important question. This is answered in the light of his policies and strategies to become the undisputed political leader of India. Much of the Machiavellian Prince deals with the problem of how a layman can raise himself from abject and obscure origins to such a position that Narendra Modi has been holding in India since 2014. The basic theme of this article is revolving around the question that is following: Can Modi’s success be attributed to techniques of The Prince in important respects? This article analyzed Narendra Modi&apos;s policies and strategies to develop an analogy between Machiavellian Prince and Modi in terms of characteristics and political strategies. This research work examines, how Narendra Modi became the strongest person in India.

This Lyotardian paradigm extends a subversive challenge to all the grand narratives that have been enjoying the status of an enviable complete code of life in the world for a long time. Even a cursory scan over the play under analysis creates a strong feel that Beckett very smartly, comprehensively and successfully questioned the relevance of the totalizing metanarratives to the present times. Being an imaginative writer, he was well aware of the fact that ridicule is a much more useful weapon than satire in the context of political literature. There are so many foundationalist ideologies that he ridicules in his dramatic writing.

Kashmir is the unfinished agenda of partition and a stumbling block in the bilateral relations between Pakistan and India. After the partition of sub-continent in 1947, Pakistan and India got their sovereign status. Kashmir conflict, a disputed status state, is the byproduct of partition. Pakistan and India are traditional arch-foes. Any clash between Pakistan and India can bring the two nuclear states toe-to-toe and accelerate into nuclear warfare. Due to the revulsion, hostility and lack of trust between the two, the peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue has been long overdue. Ever-increasing border spats, arms race and threat of terrorism between the two have augmented anxiety in the subcontinent along with the halt of talks between India and Pakistan at several times. Additionally, it hampers the economic and trade ties between the two. India, time and again, backtracked on Kashmir issue despite UN efforts to resolve the issue. Recently, Indian government has responded heavy-handedly to the Kashmiri agitators’ demand for sovereignty and revocation of ‘Special Status’ of Kashmir impacting the stability of the region in future.

Data comprises the official discourse which is used in diplomatic affairs of both the states. The extensive investigation seeks insights from the fundamentals of Critical Discourse Analysis propounded by van Dijk, Fairclough and Wodak with a special focus on Bhatia’s (2006) work. The study reveals that the image of China has always been accorded priority within Indian and Pakistani diplomatic discourse even though nature of bilateral relations among China, India and Pakistan is based on entirely different dynamics; Indian and Pakistani diplomatic discourses are reflective of sensitivities involved within the bilateral relations. Through employment of linguistic techniques of ‘positivity’, ‘evasion’ and ‘influence and power’, Indian diplomats have managed not to compromise over the fundamentals in bilateral relations with China despite Pakistan’s already strengthened and deep-rooted relations with China. While Pakistani diplomatic fronts have been equally successful in further deepening their already strengthened relations in the midst of surging controversies on CPEC, BRI and OBOR. Hence, diplomatic fronts of both the counties, through employment of ideologically loaded linguistic choices, leave no stone unturned in consolidation of the diplomatic relations with China.

The shift in average temperature is putting negative impacts on human health, food production and the natural resources. In the wake of the altered climate, water flow in the river systems is experiencing variability and uncertainty. This paper aims at studying the negative impacts of climate change on the water resources of the Indus Basin and investigate the prospects of cooperation between India and Pakistan; two major riparian nations sharing the basin. Adopting the case study approach, a theoretical framework has been built on the ‘Theory of the International Regimes’. It has been argued that institutional capacity and the dispute resolution mechanism provided in any water sharing agreement determine the extent of cooperation among the member states. Since India and Pakistan are bound by the provisions of the Indus Waters Treaty, this study tries to assess the effectiveness of this agreement in managing the negative consequences of the climate change.

This needs a valid and reliable measure to assess the differentiation of self particularly in a relationship with parents. Behavior\Emotional Reactivity Index is such a tool that fulfills this purpose. The present study was carried out to culturaly adapt and translate BERI into the Urdu language and establish the psychometric properties of Urdu version. A sample of 303 adolescents of age (M = 16.07, SD = 1.77) was taken from different schools and colleges. Scale was split into Mother and father forms for the convenience of respondents. Findings supported the original factor structure of the BERI-original version. Higher-order factor analysis showed good fit indices with excellent alpha ranges (α= .91 to α=.80). BERI scores were compared for the adolescents who were securely attached with parents and insecurely attached with parents which showed a significant difference between the groups. BERI-Urdu version was found to be a valid and reliable measure in the Pakistani cultural context which gives researchers new directions to work with adolescents.

Courts were required to adopt new methods, techniques and devices obtained through advancement of science without affecting the original intention of law. Because of modern technology, a benefit could be taken from said technology to preserve evidences and to assist proceedings of the Court in the dispensation of justice in modern times. Owing to the scientific and technological advancements the admissibility of audio and visual proofs has grown doubtful. No doubt modern evidence assist the court in reaching out to the just decision but at the same time certain criteria need to be laid down which must be satisfied to consider such evidence admissible. Different Case laws are discussed here to show how the cases were resolved on the basis of technological evidence and when and why such evidence have been rejected by the court, if it did. Moreover, legal practices developed in various countries allow our Courts to record evidence through video conferencing. The Honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan directed that in appropriate cases statement of juvenile rape victims and other cases of sensitive nature must be recorded through video conferencing to avoid inconvenience for them to come to the Court.

The boundaries of geographies play a significant role in shaping fates, biographies, social superstructures and shared collective histories of its residents. Considering this, Henri Lefebvre and Edward William Soja, argue that space is something which determines the living circumstances within the particular social framework and instigates and controls various societal happenings. City space of Karachi suffers from appalling distortions as a part of postmodern, globalized and capitalist world. By employing Lefebvre’s idea of spatial triad and Soja’s views of the trialectrics of spaciality, this paper foregrounds how social space enforces spatial injustice and serves for the inculcation of spatial cleansing in the lives of inhabitants of urban space. Using Shamsie’s Kartography as an interpretive tool for contemporary urban environment, this paper inquires the engrafting of spatial cleansing in the lives of Karachiites resulting in multiple standardization and segregation on the basis of living standards among different social strata. This research substantiates how in Kartography, Materialism nibbles the roots of social values and norms while sequentially administering Spatial Injustice in the lives of Karachiites. This paper proclaims the scarcity of execution of Spatial Justice in the lives of common people in this postmodern globalized capitalist era. This paper urges the possibility of a utopian urban space with enforced spatial justice where people can be saved from dilemmas of injustice and segregation, especially Karachiites.

The entire Middle East region is fraught with tensions, conflicts, civil wars and rivalries. From strategic interests to power grabbing, sectarian divisions, flaws in the civil and social structure of the state and society, ethnic insurrections, and many other shapes of instability syndromes can be diagnosed in this region. In the post-Arab Spring, 2011, the emerging new regional hierarchical order for power/dominance, in addition to the weakening/declining dominant US power in the region, changed the entire shape of already conflict-ridden region. New weak or collapsing states and bifurcation of the ‘status quo’ and ‘counter-hegemonic’ states along with their respective allies, made this region a prototype of instability in the regional security complex of the Middle East, as a direct result of these developments. The perpetuation of these abnormalities would not recede this instability conundrum from the region, provoking third party intervention, if not contained.

The study concludes that the unaccusative verbs only project an internal argument. It does not require the event argument. However, the said verb can be causativised by adding external argument and at the same time the event argument gets included in the valency of the derived causative of the unaccusative root. The unergative, on the other hand, requires an external argument as an obligatory argument while the internal argument is not the obligatory argument of the verb. The event argument is also a part of the valency of the verb. The APFs require one argument which is the internal argument of the verb. However, since the external argument is not available, the internal argument of the verb gets realized as the subject of the verb. The verb does not project event argument. The ergative predicates are derived by the suppression of the external argument and by the externalization of the internal argument.

Its geo-strategic location affects its national identity as a nation state. Unlike Europe in South Asia security dilemma, proxy warfare and nuclear arms race are consistent features of the regional politics. The identity of Pakistan as security-centric state gives its army disproportional power, which created institutional imbalance that directly affected constitutionalism in the country. The constitution of Pakistan is based on principles of civilian supremacy and separation of power but in reality Pakistan’s army is the most powerful institution in country. This paper argues that the structure of Pakistani politics; created institutional imbalances by the disproportionate distribution of resources is the key variable in creating dichotomy. The structure of domestic politics is based upon the principles of hostility to India, use of Islam for national unity and strategic alliances with major powers to finance defense against the neighboring countries.

There had been many crematoriums in the city but with the passage of time, one after another, disappeared from the land after partition of the Sub-continent. Those places were replaced by commercial or residential sites. There is also a graveyard in the city which is in the use of Hindu Valmik Sect. However, it was encroached by some Muslims due to very small size of population and indolence of the Hindus. Later on, the encroachments were removed by the District Government Lahore in compliance of order of the Supreme Court of Pakistan. Presently, there is a graveyard as well as a crematorium in the city.

In this study six growth models have been used for analyzing the main determinants of economic growth in case of cross countries, therefore by using these six models we have tested them for non-nested and nested encompassing through Cox test and F-test respectively. Data from 1980 to 2020 were used to analyze the cross country growth factors so therefore, the current study looked at about forty four countries with modelling these different comparative studies based on growth modelling. So, we can make these six individual models and we can estimate the General Unrestricted Model with the use of econometric technique of Non-Nested Encompassing. By evaluating the data using the Non-Nested Encompassing econometric technique, different sets of economic variables has been used to evaluate which sets of the economic variables are important to boost up the growth level of the country. And found that in case of nested model or full model it is concluded that model with lag value of GDP, trade openness, population, real export, and gross fix capital formation are the main and potential determinants to boost up the Economic Growth in most of the countries.

Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) was adopted as a theoretical framework. A total of 250 young consumers in the two cities of Southern Punjab, Pakistan was randomly sampled and data were collected via a face-to-face survey method. Partial least square technique was employed to test the model. The results showed that attitude towards organic food purchasing motivated when moral norms were activated to consume organic food products. Further, environmental knowledge moderated the relationship of organic food purchase intentions and behaviour significantly. The findings highlighted the importance of moral norms as a meaningful antecedent that could increase the TP-based psychosocial processes if consumers have sufficient environmental knowledge. Therefore, farmers, organic products marketers, government administrators, and food retailers should take initiatives not only to highlight the norms and values but also when promoting organic food production and consumption.

The study under research examines the perspectives of two similar groups of the final year students of at Higher Education Institutions of Pakistan. The first group consists of art students who received the Urdu medium of instruction (UMI), and the second group received the English medium of instruction (EMI). An empirical methodology was carried out in the present year, students answered questionnaires to find out the benefits and challenges of learning subject-based knowledge, what subject-based knowledge means to them, and their understanding of language as a teaching language. Interviews were conducted with the selected group of students who wished to participate in research. Additional information is available from the tests and results obtained in the two equivalent courses. Although many similarities have been identified between the two groups, the overall knowledge of disciplinary knowledge of English medium instruction students was not very effective, while that of UMI students was very effective. It explains the implications of the findings to continue the language rule as policy experience for teaching in higher education institutions.

Ecofeminism critiques masculine dominance highlighting its role in creating and perpetuating gender discrimination, social inequity and environmental degradation. Women suffer more because of power disparity in society. Environmental crises affect women more than men because of their already precarious existence and subaltern position. There is affinity between women and nature are victims of climate change and other environmental hazards. Cheryl Glotfelty introduced interdisciplinary approach to the study of literature and environment. Literary ecology as an emerging discipline explores the intriguing relationship between environment and literature. Ecofeminism draws on feminist critique of gender inequality showing how gender categories inscribed in power structure exploit both women and nature. Francoise d‘Eaubonne coined the term ecofeminism to critique the prevalent exploitation of both women and environment. Ecofeminism asserts that exploitation of women and degradation of the environment are the direct result of male dominance and capitalism. Ecofeminism argues for redressing the plight of women and protection of environment. Vonnegut’s play ‘Happy Birthday Wanda June’ was written at a time when the movement for the right of women and protection of environment were gaining momentum.

Understanding qawwali context requires comprehension of semantics or process of meaning creation and meaning sharing among the qawwal party and the audience. This interactive activity might frequently be hindered when interrupted by subjective meanings creation during cultural consumption. Qawwali is a cultural tradition, its semantics are conditioned by axiological premises of poetry and perceptions which are transforming. The previous researches revealed that qawwali is associated with religion which provides the religious message by singing hamd and naat. It was a means to experience Divine; therefore, semantics are multi-layered and often crossroad with values and subjective experiences. It is novel due to its ritual of Sama. It has the therapeutic power that helps mentally disturbed people and they find refuge. This study is exploratory having a small sample size of twenty purposively selected audiences. This phenomenological inquiry used ethnographic method of conversational interviews at selected shrines and cultural spaces in Islamabad. The results indicate that qawwali is a strong refuge for people facing miseries of life and they attend Sama with a belief that attending and listening will consequently resolve their issues, either psychological or physiological. They participate in Sama which teaches them how to be optimistic in a negative situation; this paper brings forth this nodal phenomenon using the verbatim explanations by the interlocutors. Semantics of Qawwali are conditioned and some of these elements are highlighted including poetry and axiology based perceptions and cultural consumption of a cultural realm.

The Kafkaesque is characterised by the following: World is a huge forking labyrinthine institution where the man has been thrown to suffer its complexities, confrontation with the labyrinth makes his existence meaningless because freedom is a taboo in no man’s land, he is punished for an unknown sin for which he seeks justification from the superior authorities, but his efforts are viewed as ludicrous or comic despite the underlying sense of tragedy. (5) The Kafkaesque tendency to present tragic situation comically is also explored in Abe’s novel. The paper studies the effect of higher authorities exercising their power over man and the inscrutability of cosmic structures continuously undermining human freedom in nightmarish conditions. The paper establishes Kobo Abe in the literary world as a writer who portrays the hollowness and futility of human lives with a Kafkaesque touch.

It controlled the Indian education field till the establishment of Indian Education Commission, 1882. The Despatch provided space to Christian missionaries by promising government’s gradual withdrawal from the education in favour of missionaries. It also facilitated the missionaries by offering system of ‘grants on aid’ to the private bodies. Consequently, the missionaries fancied to replace the government institutions in the Punjab and initiated their efforts to increase the number of their educational institutions. They tried to occupy the educational field by establishing more and more educational institutions. But after the Recommendations of the Indian Education Commission 1882, a change in their policy of numeric increase of educational institutions is quite visible. With the turn of the century, they are found to be eager to establish a few institutions with good quality of education. This paper intends to analyse different factors behind the change of their policy of quantitative dominance to qualitative improvement. It also attempts to evaluate how their change of policy worked and what steps were taken to improve the quality of their educational institutions. Following the historical method qualitative data comprising educational reports, missionaries’ autobiographies, Reports of missionaries’ conferences, and the other relevant primary and secondary sources has been collected from different repositories. The analysis of the data suggests that the attitude of the administration of the education department and the recommendations of Indian Education Commission were the major driving forces behind the change of missionaries’ educational policy in the 20th century. The missionaries, after adopting the new policy, worked on the quality of education in their institutions and became successful.

Lack of capacity and poor standards of governance caused nontraditional security challenges to Pakistan too. The NCOC is the central nerve center to guide the national response to COVID-19 by Pakistan and can be best analyzed in the light of the decision-making theory of Naturalist Decision Making (NDM). The study points out the effective role performed by NCOC at policy formation through a more prosaic combination of science, data, decision making and execution of decisions at the level of federalism. The study highlights the changing patterns of government’s approach during the pandemic at various levels. Pakistan faced economic, political and social crisis during this phase. This study uses a survey and key informant interviews as the source of analysis for qualitative data collection. By applying the decision- making theory, the paper extends that there is a need to use a model to balance the existing gap within the system, to meet challenges. The study suggests a coordinating approach among various units and center; that might raise the level of performance to meet the nontraditional security challenges with innovation, creativity and boldness.

Judicial review is a remedy provided by the public law and is exercised by the superior and higher courts to supervise administrative authorities&apos; powers and functions. The main objective of the judicial review is to ensure the fair and transparent treatment of individuals by public authorities. The ground of the judicial review, i.e., Unreasonableness or irrationality or popularly known as Wednesbury Unreasonableness was introduced by lord Greene in the Wednesbury Corporation case in 1948. Initially, the scope of this ground of judicial review was very narrow and was allowed only in rare cases. However, with the development of administrative law and Human rights, it also developed. Its development resulted in different controversies and issues about the application of this ground. The main issue is about its encroachment in the jurisdiction of other branches of the government i.e., the parliament and executive. The free and loose application of this principle results in confusion and conflict between different organs of the government. The present paper is based on the implications of the limitations on the ground of Wednesbury Unreasonableness both on the judicial and administrative bodies in Pakistan to avoid the chaos and confusion that results in the criticisms on this ground of judicial review.
